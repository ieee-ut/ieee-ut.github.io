	<h2>Giving</h2>

	<p>
		We would like to thank the UT alumni, IEEE members, and corporate partners who have contributed to our yearly initiatives. Without them, endeavors like our general meetings, annual resume workshop, leadership retreats, and fajita fests would not be possible.		
	</p>

	<p>
		If you would like to support IEEE's initiatives, please see the options available below. Any gift to our branch is tax deductable and greatly appreciated. 
	</p>

	<h3>The IEEE Endowment Fund</h3>

	<p>
		Our branch established the IEEE UT Student Branch Endowment Fund to expand funding for services that promote the success of UT ECE students. We strive to reward students who excel academically and embody the values of UT and IEEE with annual, merit-based scholarships.
	</p>

	<p>
		Additionally, this fund allows us to support our amazing IEEE societies: Communications Society, Computer Society, Power and Energy Society, and Robotics and Automation Society. These student orgaizations grant members an opportunity to participate in hands-on projects and competitions, allowing them to gain knowledge they not found in the classroom.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since its founding in May 2012, our branch has raised over $15,000 for the fund! Every contribution to the endowment fund increases our capability to promote project-based learning and reward students for their outstanding achievement.
	</p>
