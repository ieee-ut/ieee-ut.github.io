<p>
	IEEE's hosting an end-of-the-year blowout party like no other; it's on a boat. Everything's going down (the party, not the barge) May 4th, so be prepared for good food, music, swimming, and lame Star Wars jokes.
</p>
<p>
	We'll be departing from ENS 133 around 2pm and returning to campus around 8.
</p>
<p>
	Space is limited, so be sure to buy a $5 ticket in the IEEE office (ENS 133) to take part!
