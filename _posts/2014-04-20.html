	Welcome to the (potential) new IEEE site! It's exciting to escape the clutches of the yore; a cumbersome and monstrous beast it was. With the help of my current MMP compatriots, I've built this site from the ground up to <strike>avoid actual work</strike> best meet the needs of an evolving IEEE media presence.

	This page contains a few example posts to give an impression of what would show up here. In addition, the links in the nav-bar up top give a glimpse of how other pages might be populated. Not everything is fully functional or developed, and the new Multimedia and Publicity officer can expect to be improving and adding to the site over the next year. Rome wasn't built in a day after all, regardless of how irrelevant that fact is to this setting.
