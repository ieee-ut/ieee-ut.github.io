	Welcome to the new IEEE site! It's exciting to escape the clutches of the website of yore; a cumbersome and monstrous beast it was. My MMP compatriots and I have built this site from the ground up to <strike>avoid actual work</strike> best meet the needs of an evolving IEEE media presence.

	Not everything is fully functional or developed, and the new Multimedia and Publicity officer can expect to be improving and adding to the site over the next year. Rome wasn't built in a day after all, regardless of how irrelevant that fact is to this setting.
