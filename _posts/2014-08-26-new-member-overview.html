	Thanks to all who came out to our booth at Gone to Engineering this evening! We certainly had a lot of fun sharing our experience with IEEE, and hope to share more of our experience with IEEE and being an ECE major tomorrow night at Double Dave's. Check out the previous post to see all we have planned for the rest of the week.

	For prospective new members, we thought to organize some helpful links and info to keep connected with all things IEEE.
